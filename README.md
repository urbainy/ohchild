This is a simple math calculation practicing tool for 3~10 years old children.

It can practice plus, minus, multiplication and divide calculation.

We have three difficulty levels for each math method by setting the digit from 1 to 3.

Practicing time longer or shorter is up to you by setting the count down timer (the icon with a
clock).

There is easiest level for the beginner. It Uses dices to show number by dots to provide better
feeling for children.
